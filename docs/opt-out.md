# Opt-Out of Scanning your Repository
Navigate to your repository

Go to issues:

![gitlab_issues](img/issues.png)

Open our automatically generated scanner issue:

![scanner_issue](img/scanner_issue.png)

Choose "Edit" on the right site under "Labels"
(by default there is a label called "automated-credential-scan")

![labels](img/labels.png)

Add a new Label called "automated-credential-scan-disabled" to the already existing issue:

![disabled_label](img/disabled_scanner_label.png)

Save everything and you are done. If you wish, you can close the issue now and you will never get bothered again.
