# Automated credential scanner

Background: We wanted to scan all our GitLab projects for leaked credentials. This way we want to improve our security standards company wide. This ReadMe explains how we use KICS to scan all repositories and how you can opt-out.

This repo runs a CI Job which scans all accessible repositories for credentials and creates a ticket with the scan result if there are any findings.

If you fixed the findings you can close the created issue and this job will automatically reopen and update the existing ticket if there are new issues found.

## Documentation
